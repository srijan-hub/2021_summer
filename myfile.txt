Shrek Is The Most Powerful Being In The Universe, And Here’S Why: According To The Height Of A Donkey (Which Is 3.5 Feet On Average) Shrek Is 4 Donkeys Tall, Which Means He Is A Godly Size Of 14 Feet Tall. Second If Any Of You Remember The Original Despicable Shrek, You Know There Is A Scene When Farquaad Kidnaps The Three Baby Ogres And Shoots A Series Of Heat-Seeking Missiles At Shrek, He Then Dodges Them All. According To The Speed Of An Average Ballistic Missile (1900 Mph) And The Size Of The Missile According To His Ankle Size, Shrek Can Perceive And Move At Such A Sped That The Missiles Only Move 9.5 Miles Per Hour, 0.5% Of Their Original Speed. Plus After This Shrek Punches A Dragon And It Is Paralyzed Meaning Its Spine Is Probably Shattered, To Remind You It Would Require A Force Greater Than 3,000 Newtons To Fracture The Spine. That’S Equal To The Impact Created By A 500-Pound Car Crashing Into A Wall At 30 Miles Per Hour. I Rest My Case.
